# Jinxxy DMCA Record

#### What is this?

Inspired by [Github](https://github.com/github/dmca), [Lumen](https://lumendatabase.org/topics/1) (*formerly Chilling Effects*) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/dmca), this repo contains the text of DMCA takedown notices and counter-notices we've received here at Jinxxy. We publish them as they are received, redacting only private information.


#### Why is this?

In short, we believe that transparency on a specific and ongoing level is essential to good governance. Chilling Effects/Lumen explained it well in 2014 ([archive.org mirror; not present on their current site](https://web.archive.org/web/20140101160724/http://chillingeffects.org/#donato-if:~:text=We%20are%20excited%20about%20the%20new,its%20misuse%20to%20%22chill%22%20legitimate%20activity.)): "We are excited about the new opportunities the Internet offers individuals to express their views . . . but concerned that not everyone feels the same way. Study to date suggests that cease and desist letters often silence Internet users, whether or not their claims have legal merit." (About, ChillingEffects.org, Sept. 2014, licensed under [CC-BY-3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/)). Similarly, we post takedown notices here to document their potential to "chill" speech.


#### What does it mean if there's a notice posted here?

It only means that we received the notice on the indicated date. It does ***not*** mean that the content was unlawful or wrong. It does ***not*** mean that the user identified in the notice has done anything wrong. We don't make or imply any judgment about the merit of the claims they make. We post these notices and requests only for informational purposes.

For more details, see our [DMCA Policy](https://support.jinxxy.com/hc/en-us/articles/16765837432205-Terms-of-Use).

#### Anatomy of a takedown notice

In the spirit of transparency, we post each takedown notice that we process without making any changes to the text, except for redacting private information, and adding a few annotations to help you better understand how we processed the notice. Here are the annotations you might see and what they mean.

1. **We gave the content owners a chance to make changes before we processed the notice.** 

When you see this at the top of a notice
>Before disabling any content in relation to this takedown notice, Jinxxy
>- contacted the owners of some or all of the affected links to give them an opportunity to make changes that could have prevented the need to disable the content 
>- provided information on how to submit a DMCA Counter Notice. 

it means that either the notice did not allege that the entire contents of the page infringe, or the copyright holder identified other changes that could be made to the content to resolve the alleged infringement. As we note in our [DMCA Policy](https://support.jinxxy.com/hc/en-us/articles/16765837432205-Terms-of-Use), in those cases, because Jinxxy cannot disable access to specific sections of the page's content, we will contact the user and give them approximately 1 business day to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. 

If the page owner makes the necessary changes, then Jinxxy will not disable the content. In some cases, that means the content is currently available despite being listed in the notice. In other cases, content might be unavailable because the user decided to delete it.
